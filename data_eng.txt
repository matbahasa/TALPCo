2854	I read the composition Mr. Matsui wrote.
2855	I will hand in the composition to the teacher tomorrow.
2856	When writing an answer, you must read the question carefully.
2857	This question is very easy.
2858	There is a kanji test at school every day.
2860	If you practise a lot, your Japanese will get better.
2861	Yesterday's test was easy.
2862	I teach Japanese to foreigners.

2887	You may not talk to the person next to you during class.
2888	There is a bookstore next to that cafe.
2889	Mr. Matsui's house is near my house.
2890	I gave the bag to Mr. Matsui that was near me.
2891	I will go to the police box because I lost my wallet.
2892	I lost the magazine I borrowed from Mr. Matsui.
2893	My friend is coming, so I will clean this room.
2894	This room has no window.
2895	There is a calendar on the desk.
2896	I bought a calendar for next year at the department store.
2898	It is dark, so I will turn on the light.
2899	I was tired yesterday, so I fell asleep quickly.
2900	I didn't know the time, so I looked at the clock in the classroom.
2901	I study with the lights on.
2902	There is a vase in the lobby.
2906	This road is narrow and dangerous.
2907	We cross that intersection and go left.

2921	I want to go across the river, so I will cross the bridge.
2923	It was hot, so we swam in the pool.
2924	I am not good at singing, so I am thinking of practising.
2925	My brother taught me how to play football because he is good.
2926	Mr. Matsui is good at cooking.
2927	I am not good at drawing pictures.
2928	I think taking the train to school is faster than taking the bus.
2929	Mr. Matsui runs fast.
2931	I walk very slowly.
2933	I cannot run anymore because my feet hurt.
2934	The bird is flying over there.
2935	I am thinking of travelling abroad next year.
2936	I can speak English.
2937	I use the dictionary to study English.
2939	I will meet a foreigner friend tomorrow.
2940	When you turn right at the intersection over there, there will be an embassy.

2949	The meat at this store is cheap today.
2950	There are a lot of stores over there that are lined up.
2951	I buy fruits and vegetables at a vegetable shop.
2952	It is cheaper at a vegetable shop than a supermarket.
2953	Yesterday's dinner was meat.
2954	I like meat more than fish.
2955	That beef is the most expensive of all the kinds of meat.
2956	I cannot eat pork.
2957	Chicken is cheap, but beef tastes better.
2958	The fish is good where it is close to the sea.
